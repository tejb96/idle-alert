# Idle Alert Plugin for RuneLite

The **Idle Alert** plugin for RuneLite helps you stay alert and avoid being caught idle in *Old School RuneScape* (OSRS). It notifies you when certain idle conditions occur, such as idle animations, no movement, or low hitpoints. This plugin is great for ensuring you remain active while playing and helps prevent unwanted inactivity.

## Features

### 1. **Idle Animation Alert**
- Get notified when your character enters an idle animation state.
- Useful for ensuring you’re actively engaging with the game and not standing still for too long.

### 2. **Idle Movement Alert**
- Receive notifications when your character hasn't moved for a specified number of game ticks.
- Perfect for alerting you when you're idling in one spot without moving, and is useful when following guides.

### 3. **Low HP Alert**
- Get alerted when your HP (and absorption in the Nightmare Zone) drops below a specified threshold.
- **Important**: When your HP is below the threshold, the plugin will repeatedly notify you, helping to prevent you from dying by reminding you to eat or drink.

## Configuration

You can configure the plugin with the following options:

### Idle Animation Alert:
- **Enable/Disable Idle Animation Alerts**  
  Toggle whether the plugin should notify you when your character enters an idle animation.

### Idle Movement Alert:
- **Enable/Disable Idle Movement Alerts**  
  Toggle whether the plugin should notify you when your character hasn’t moved for a specified number of ticks.

### Low HP Alert:
- **Enable/Disable Low HP Alerts**  
  Toggle whether the plugin should notify you when your total HP drops below a defined threshold.
  
- **Set HP Threshold**  
  Adjust the HP threshold for low health notifications. The default is set to 15 HP. If your HP drops below this value, you’ll receive frequent notifications to ensure you don’t die.
